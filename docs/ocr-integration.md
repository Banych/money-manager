# OCR Integration & Receipt Processing

## Overview

The Money Manager app includes AI-powered receipt scanning to automatically extract transaction details and itemized purchases from receipt images. This reduces manual data entry and improves accuracy.

## Simple UI Flow

1. **Upload Receipt:** User uploads/takes photo in expense form
2. **Processing:** Show loading state while OCR runs
3. **Review Results:** Display extracted data for user confirmation
4. **Edit & Save:** Allow manual corrections before saving expense

## Configuration

```env
# Simple OCR setup
OCR_PROVIDER=google-vision
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/credentials.json
```

## Phase 2 Goals

- Keep it simple: Focus on basic text extraction first
- Manual review: Always allow user to correct OCR results
- Gradual improvement: Learn from user corrections over time
- Fallback: Provide manual entry option if OCR fails

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

- Multiple OCR providers for comparison
- Automatic item categorization
- Improved accuracy through machine learning
- Batch processing for multiple receipts
