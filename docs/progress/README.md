## Progress Logs

This directory contains chronological session/sprint logs capturing project status, decisions, and upcoming priorities.

### Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-session.md` – One file per significant development session or sprint boundary.

### Purpose

- Provide an auditable trail of scope changes.
- Keep roadmap and reality aligned.
- Accelerate onboarding by showing evolution history.

### How To Use

1. At end of each focused work session, add a new log summarizing:
   - What changed
   - Current status vs roadmap
   - Risks / blockers
   - Next actionable steps
2. Link any major architectural decisions to `docs/architecture.md` or create an ADR if large impact.
